# -Syntecxhub_-Time-series-category-charts
The objective is to visualize sales trends over time and analyze performance across categories using Python. Through this project, we demonstrate skills in data visualization, time series analysis, and chart-based storytelling.
Tools & Libraries

Python 3

Pandas → for data manipulation

NumPy → for numerical operations

Matplotlib → for chart plotting

Seaborn → for enhanced visuals and style

 Dataset

The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated to simulate real-world sales records.
It includes:

Date: Sales transaction date

Category: Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Groceries, etc.)

Sales: Randomly generated sales values

This approach ensures the project runs independently without needing an external file.
